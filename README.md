## My process 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

- Built app with mobile first workflow
- Use Redux in React app for state management
-  Enhance user experience by providing current state to the user when fetching data (`pending`, `fulfilled`, and `rejected`) 
- Use `ThemeProvider` from Styled Component to toggle Dark Mode
